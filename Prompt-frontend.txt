Context for Copilot (IMPORTANT – READ FULLY):
You are generating the frontend for a cybersecurity project called VulnScan Lite.
The backend is already implemented and supports anonymous scans, scan history, and scan result retrieval.

❌ There is NO authentication system
❌ There are NO login or registration APIs
❌ There are NO user accounts or JWT tokens

The frontend must only implement what the backend actually supports, nothing extra.
PROJECT OVERVIEW

VulnScan Lite is a lightweight, on-demand web security health check tool designed for:

Small website owners

Bloggers

Developers

Students

Non-technical users

Users enter a website URL, start a scan, and receive a clear, non-intrusive security report.

This tool performs passive security checks only and does not attempt exploitation or aggressive penetration testing.
🎯 FRONTEND GOALS

Simple

Functional

Clean

Professional

Industrial / cybersecurity-style UI

No unnecessary complexity

Fully integrated with backend APIs
🧰 FRONTEND TECH STACK (STRICT – DO NOT DEVIATE)

Use only:

React (Vite)

JavaScript (ES6+)

Tailwind CSS

Axios for API calls

React Router

🚫 EXPLICITLY DO NOT ADD

Do NOT generate any of the following:

Login page

Register page

AuthContext

JWT handling

Protected routes

User dashboard

Subscription management logic

Payment gateways

Email notifications

Background cron logic

If it does not exist in the backend, do not invent it.

🔎 SCAN FLOW (MUST MATCH BACKEND EXACTLY)
Scan Start

User enters a URL in a single input field

URL is validated on frontend

User clicks Start Scan

Frontend sends:

POST /api/scan


Backend responds immediately with:

scan_id

status: pending
Scan Progress

Display a ScanProgress component

Poll backend every few seconds:

GET /api/scan/status/{scan_id}


Show:

Pending

In Progress

Completed

Failed
Scan Completion

When status becomes completed:

Fetch full result:

GET /api/scan/{scan_id}


Navigate to ScanResult page

Render results in a report-card style layout
🧪 VULNERABILITY DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS

Each scan report must show:

High-Level Summary

Target URL

Scan timestamp

Overall risk level

Security score (if backend provides it)

Vulnerability Categories

Render results clearly grouped:

HTTP Header Analysis
(CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)

Cookie Security Flags
(Secure, HttpOnly)

SSL / TLS Configuration
(certificate validity, weak ciphers)

CMS / Framework Detection
(WordPress, Joomla, etc.)

Outdated Software Indicators

Each Vulnerability Must Display

Title

Severity (Low / Medium / High)

Color-coded badge

Description

Why it matters

Suggested remediation

External reference link (if provided by backend)

📜 SCAN HISTORY PAGE

If backend supports scan history:

Fetch from:

GET /api/scan/history


Display list/table of past scans

Each item shows:

Domain

Date

Risk level

Status

Clicking an item navigates to its ScanResult page

💰 PRICING PAGE (INFORMATIONAL ONLY)

Since no auth or payment logic exists yet:

Create a static Pricing page

Explain:

Free scan (limited)

Premium scan (conceptual)

Pro subscription (conceptual)

Clearly label pricing as planned / informational

No checkout buttons

No payment logic

⚠️ DISCLAIMER (MANDATORY & VISIBLE)

Create a reusable Disclaimer component and show it on:

Home page

Scan result page

Text must clearly state:

This tool performs passive, non-intrusive security checks only.
It is not a substitute for professional penetration testing.
Only scan websites that you own or have explicit permission to test.

🎨 UI / STYLING GUIDELINES

Style must feel:

Industrial

Cybersecurity-oriented

Professional

Design Rules

Dark theme (slate / zinc / neutral)

Subtle gradients

Monospaced or clean fonts

Rounded cards

Clear spacing

Minimal animations

Responsive for mobile & desktop

🌍 ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

Use .env:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api


Never hardcode backend URLs.

🚀 FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Generate:

Fully functional React frontend

Clean, readable, commented code

No mock data

No placeholders

No unused features

Direct backend integration

Ready to run with npm run dev

🧠 IMPORTANT CONTEXT

This frontend is part of the same project conversation as the backend.
Assume:

Backend routes already exist

Response structures are already defined

Frontend must adapt to backend, not vice versa

✅ OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

Generate actual working code, not explanations.

Start by generating:

Vite + React setup

Axios configuration

Routing

Core pages

Scan workflow components

Styling
